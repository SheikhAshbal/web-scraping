He was originally sent by DIO to confront the Joestar Group alongside J. Geil. However, after his partner is defeated first, he makes a tactical retreat, returning for two following encounters. He first reappears caught in the cross fire of Enya the Hag\'s own attempt to kill the Joestar Group and one last time to attack them himself alongside Boingo, finally being defeated in the latter encounter.\nHol Horse also appears in the spin-off manga "Crazy Diamond\'s Demonic Heartbreak" as a main character.', 'sections': [{'title': 'Appearance', 'content': 'Hol Horse is a man of above-average height and medium build.

However, whenever he is at a disadvantage, his cowardice surfaces.\nAs a henchman for DIO, Hol Horse\'s confidence fluctuates significantly. Unlike many overconfident Stand users, Hol Horse is primarily aware of how weak his Stand, Emperor, is when compared to most Stands. This knowledge combined with his affable personality (since he has no problem being a second-in-command rather than a "Number 1") makes him willing to partner up with someone else. In that case, Hol Horse is very confident that he can take on anyone. This confidence extends to whenever he can convince himself that he has the advantage, which leads to his assassination attempt on DIO with a calm determination the vampire complimented and deemed enough to prevail against the Joestar Group. On the other hand, if Hol Horse sees that he doesn\'t have the upper hand, he reveals his cowardly self and doesn\'t hesitate to flee in the face of danger. Hol Horse fled twice, for this reason; first when he learned that J. Geil was killed, and secondly when he saw the opportunity of stealing the Joestar Group\'s 4x4. Still, Hol Horse has a lingering pride and his first reflex, as seen against Enya the Hag and DIO, is to put up a fight if humiliated.\nHol Horse considers himself a ladies\' man. By his word, he has girlfriends from all over the world, but reveals that he seduces them to make use of them later rather than from any romantic feelings. Although he almost always lies to women, Hol Horse is against hitting them. He vehemently denied Tohth\'s prediction of him kicking a lady from behind would come to pass, as he had sworn never to hit women. This prediction is proven later out of Hol Horse\'s own compulsion, though he kicked the woman to save her from a deadly scorpion. This moral standard didn\'t prevent Hol Horse from pointing his Stand at Enya. However, that was out of self-defense as the latter had blamed Hol Horse for her son\'s death and refused to listen to reason.\nHol Horse has a greedy personality, carrying out assassinations for money, and the possibility of taking DIO\'s treasures was one motivation for his attempt to kill DIO.'}, {'title': 'Abilities', 'content': "Main article: Emperor\n“\nThe gun's mightier than the sword!\n”\n—Hol Horse\nHol Horse's Stand is Emperor; a handgun over the bullets of which he maintains control of a fine degree (in a style nullifying the need for marksmanship) as he can use them to home in onto his targets.\nHol Horse partners with J.

Unlike most of DIO\'s henchmen Hol Horse is a mercenary, not imbued with a flesh bud and fighting willingly. He is allowed to quit hunting the Crusaders whenever he wants (albeit his payment is forfeit) and even struck an alliance with them when facing Enya.\nHis cowardice and satisfaction with a "Second best" title gives him agency over of his own path, and allowed him to escape the consequences of defeat from Crusaders numerous times. He also accepts DIO\'s ultimatum to fall in line or die after a failed attempt at betraying him, representing self control symbolized by The Emperor. Understanding his own weaknesses and remaining in those lines allows Hol Horse to survive and thrive where other antagonists have not.

After separating from J. Geil and the protagonists, Hol Horse catches up to Polnareff and Noriaki Kakyoin and learns that they had already killed J. Geil.

At first, Hol Horse is taken aback by Tohth's strange predictions but is ultimately convinced of their reliability after he kicks a woman to save her from a scorpion and is rewarded with a jewel.\nHol Horse and Boingo then stalk the Joestar Group in the streets of Cairo, knowing that Hol Horse must now put his fingers in Polnareff's nose which will somehow end up in victory. Polnareff does surprise Hol Horse and almost takes him out but Boingo distracts Polnareff, allowing Hol Horse to put his fingers in Polnareff's nose. As the rest of the group comes to Polnareff, Hol Horse is forced to hide in a corner and hold Polnareff at gunpoint to force him to lie.

The delay is significantly shorter for the "& Boingo" version of Hol Horse.\nPredictably, most of Hol Horse\'s strategies revolve around utilizing his gun (Emperor) to harass his opponents from the distance. He possesses no Active Stand, which renders him extremely vulnerable to chip damage (which having a Stand active would normally block) and forces the player take a more aggressive role, or at the very least avoid attacks instead of blocking them. His Glass Shower move is excellent for denying aerial attacks and forcing opponents backwards, while Hanged Man (normal Hol Horse only) can help Hol by stabbing his opponent in the leg and paralyzing them while they are on the ground.\nWhile all of Hol\'s super techniques are very usable, the one that shines the most is his Dangan no Modou, which allows him to fire a bullet and freely control it with the joystick for a few moments. This attack is completely unblockable, and can be used repeatedly until Hol\'s super gauge is empty. This is a great way of finishing off an enemy who is playing defensively or just equalizing an opponent who has more energy than you.\nIn summary, Hol Horse shines at medium range, as his close quarters attacks are less than impressive, and his bullets become easy to avoid from across the screen. Aggressive gameplay is the way to go with him, as most of his delays give enough buffer to link together attacks. Keep the pressure on with plenty of straight shots (be sure to mix-up between high and low to keep your opponent guessing—all of your bullets CAN be steered to hit high or low, and your enemy has to block them correctly!) and use the Glass Shower to cover your tracks when they try to rush. Hanged Man is great for opening your opponent to a world of hurt from your bullets, but if you\'re with Boingo, you may have to attack carefully or be on the defensive. Or, you can just experiment with his moveset and make your own strategy, as his techniques allow for a great deal of flexibility depending on who your opponent is.'}, {'title': 'Techniques', 'content': 'Mighty Gun\nGlass Shower\nHanged Man\nSuper Mighty Gun\nWild West\nWooden Nickels\nPipe Maze\nAbsolute Premonition'}]}, {'title': 'All Star Battle (PS3)', 'content': 'Hol Horse returns as a playable character in the PS3 title.

He is voiced by Hōchū Ōtsuka in this game, who previously voiced young Joseph Joestar in the Capcom game.\nAlong with Enrico Pucci, Kosaku-Kira, Johnny Joestar, Koichi Hirose, and Giorno Giovanna, Hol Horse is a character who can utilize more than one Stand during a match as part of his moveset; Emperor, and The Hanged Man of J. Geil, who is never shown aside from it.\nSome of his attacks return from the Capcom game (Heritage for the Future), though he is otherwise newly outfitted with different abilities. Despite being one of the mass majority of playable characters in the game with the "Stand" Style, Hol Horse cannot switch between movesets, nor does he have access to the Stand Rush ability. He shares this effect with Guido Mista and Diavolo. Instead, Hol Horse\'s Style button triggers the skill "Gun beats sword", wherein he trick-spins Emperor as it glows, enhancing the next skill marked with a star. Said abilities can be instantly performed following the skill.\nDuring a fight, Hol Horse uses moves that were loosely based on those featured in Stardust Crusaders.\nI\'ll be right back!: Hol Horse runs away from the opponent, making him one of the only three characters in the game capable of running in the opposite direction; the others being Joseph Joestar (both versions) and Iggy.\nYou lose, loser!: Hol Horse fires a high-speed bullet.

As long as the Style button is held, the bullet\'s trajectory can be manually changed up to 4 times (Comboable through Puttsun Cancel). This move is marked with a star and can be enhanced to increase the number of times the trajectory can be changed to unlimited and the number of times the bullet hits the opponent as well.

Whenever he faces off against a female opponent (Lisa Lisa, Jolyne Cujoh, or Ermes Costello), Hol Horse will have special dialogue with them as he attempts to flirt, only to be met by repulsion. An icon will display above his Heart Heat Gauge depicting a yellow silhouette of his head as a pink heart appears in the smoke of his cigarette. During battle, Hol Horse\'s attack power is reduced, but his HHG builds faster.\nHol Horse\'s HHA, "Eat this!", begins with him spitting his cigarette up into the air shortly before he fires a volley of 4 to 10 bullets, dependent on whether or not an attack button was rapidly pressed. Each bullet comes back around to hit again before disappearing for a total of 8 to 20 hits. The last hit will knock the opponent to the ground, and Hol Horse will catch his cigarette back in his mouth. The HHA will deal more damage if "Gun beats sword" is in effect, making the bullets hit yet another time.\nHol Horse\'s GHA, "Hol Horse is gonna kill ya!", starts with him throwing an empty glass bottle into the air and shooting it. If the opponent is caught in the shard rain, Hanged Man will appear in the mirror world in front of them and stab them in the shoulder, immobilizing them and prompting Hol Horse to shoot. Hol Horse complying happily, he fires a bullet that curves and dances around the falling glass shards before finally flying with high speed straight toward its target: the opponent\'s forehead. The GHA can hit a downed opponent, but cannot hit at point-blank or close range.\nBesides the cast from Part 3 (not counting Old Joseph, Iggy, and Vanilla Ice, all of whom are DLC), Hol Horse has special intro dialogue with Guido Mista, wherein Hol Horse decides to see which one of the two is the faster gunman, a challenge that Mista accepts.

Araki mentions this is part of the reason Hol Horse shows up multiple times throughout the story and why there is at least one group shot with Hol Horse present.\nIn Heritage for the Future, Hol Horse is one of the special characters that doesn\'t turn into a child form when hit by Alessi\'s Stand, Sethan\'s ability. Rather, he becomes the boy that attempted to sell Kakyoin and Polnareff things during their fight against J. Geil. For his "Hol Horse & Boingo" variation, he seems to swap places with Boingo, and hides under the latter\'s box in the background, although players can see a young Hol Horse\'s arm sticking out firing Emperor when using certain attacks.\nAraki admits that the idea for Hol Horse might have been influenced by the titular character in the manga, Cobra; a gunslinger who always smokes and has the ability to fire projectiles without having a direct line-of-sight.\nHol Horse makes four separate physical appearances across different arcs, the most out of any minor antagonist in the entire series. He debuts in "Emperor and the Hanged Man" (Chapters 140-145), then reappears in "Justice" (Chapters 154-159), again in "Shooting DIO?!" (Chapter 210) and finally in "Hol Horse and Boingo" (Chapters 217-221).\nThe injury Hol Horse received to retire him parrelel how he had previously defeated Muhammad Avdol, a bullet wound to the head which barely missed becoming fatal.\nThere is a bootleg figure of Hol Horse under the name "Cowboy", which seems to wrongly attribute DIO\'s Stand; The World, to Hol Horse on it\'s packaging.\nHol Horse\'s quote "The gun is mightier than the sword" is a parody of Edward Bulwer-Lytton\'s quote "The pen is mightier than the sword", who is also well known for his opening words of "It was a dark and stormy night".\nOn August 17th, 2021, it was announced that Hol Horse was set to feature in a then-untitled spin-off to the main manga alongside Josuke Higashikata of Part 4, sometime that winter. This project was later revealed to be the "Crazy Diamond\'s Demonic Heartbreak" series, written by Houhei Kadano, who was also responsible for writing the Purple Haze Feedback light novel. However, unlike Purple Haze Feedback, the illustrations were provided by Tasuku Karasuma, instead of Hirohiko Araki himself. Its first volume was released on December 18th, 2021, and set just before the events of Diamond is Unbreakable.
